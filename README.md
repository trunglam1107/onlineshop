# My Shop (sample)

This is a minimal React + Vite + Tailwind sample e-commerce site with:

- Product listing, banner slideshow
- Search & category filter
- Cart side-drawer (localStorage)
- Checkout page with shipping form & mock payment methods
- Orders saved to localStorage and Order Detail page
- My Account with Personal Info, avatar upload + crop (react-easy-crop), Security tab (change password), Order History
- Login/Register (localStorage) with 'remember me'

Install:
npm install
npm run dev

Notes:
- Avatar cropping requires react-easy-crop; included in package.json.
- This is a frontend-only mock. No real payments.
